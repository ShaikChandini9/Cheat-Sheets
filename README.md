## Java Cheat Sheet

### Java Basics
- **Java** is an object-oriented, class-based programming language. It follows the principle of "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA), meaning that once you write a Java program, it can run on any platform that supports Java without needing recompilation.
- **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)** is responsible for running Java applications. It converts bytecode into machine code for the underlying operating system.

### Object-Oriented Programming
- **OOP Principles**:
  - **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods that operate on the data within one unit, and restricting access to some of the object's components.
  - **Inheritance**: A mechanism where a new class inherits the properties and behavior (methods) of an existing class.
  - **Polymorphism**: The ability to use a single entity (method or object) to represent different types.
  - **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.

### Data Types
- **Primitive Data Types**:
  - `int`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`, etc.
  - These represent basic values and have a fixed size and behavior.
- **Reference Data Types**:
  - **Classes**, **Interfaces**, **Arrays**, etc., store references to objects.

### Control Flow
- Java supports standard control flow statements like **if-else**, **switch-case**, **for loop**, **while loop**, and **do-while loop** to control the execution of code based on conditions.

### Collections Framework
- **Collections** provide a way to store and manage groups of objects. The Java Collections Framework includes **List**, **Set**, **Map**, etc.
  - **List**: An ordered collection (e.g., `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`).
  - **Set**: A collection with no duplicate elements (e.g., `HashSet`).
  - **Map**: A collection that maps keys to values (e.g., `HashMap`).

## JUnit Cheat Sheet

### JUnit Basics
- **JUnit** is a framework for writing and running tests in Java. It follows a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach, allowing developers to write tests before the actual code.
- JUnit provides annotations and assertions to facilitate the writing and execution of test cases.

### Test Annotations
- **@Test**: Marks a method as a test case.
- **@BeforeEach**: Indicates that the annotated method should be executed before each test method.
- **@AfterEach**: Indicates that the annotated method should be executed after each test method.
- **@BeforeAll**: Marks a method to run once before all test methods.
- **@AfterAll**: Marks a method to run once after all test methods.
  
### Assertions
- Assertions are used to check if a certain condition holds true during testing.
  - **assertEquals(expected, actual)**: Verifies if the expected value is equal to the actual value.
  - **assertTrue(condition)**: Verifies if the condition is true.
  - **assertFalse(condition)**: Verifies if the condition is false.

### Test Lifecycle
- The test lifecycle in JUnit includes running tests in the order of their annotations, starting with `@BeforeAll` and `@BeforeEach` before each test method and finishing with `@AfterEach` and `@AfterAll` after the test execution.

## Spring Boot Cheat Sheet

### Spring Boot Basics
- **Spring Boot** is a framework designed to simplify the setup and development of Spring applications. It reduces boilerplate code by providing auto-configuration, starter templates, and embedded servers like Tomcat or Jetty.
- Spring Boot applications are typically packaged as executable JAR or WAR files.

### Spring Boot Configuration
- **`application.properties` or `application.yml`** files are used for configuring the applicationâ€™s properties.
  - Example: `server.port=8080` specifies the port number the Spring Boot application will run on.
- **@Value**: Injects values into Spring Beans from the configuration file.
  - Example: `@Value("${server.port}") private int port;`

### Creating REST APIs
- Spring Boot allows you to create RESTful web services easily using `@RestController` and `@RequestMapping`.
  - **@RestController**: Marks a class as a controller that handles HTTP requests and returns JSON or XML responses.
  - **@RequestMapping**: Maps HTTP requests to handler methods of MVC and REST controllers.
  - Example: `@GetMapping("/hello")` maps a GET request to a method that returns data.

### Testing in Spring Boot
- **@SpringBootTest**: Runs the whole Spring Boot application context and is used for integration tests.
- **@MockBean**: Used for mocking beans within a Spring Boot test context.
