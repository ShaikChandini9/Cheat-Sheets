## 1. Java Basics

This section covers key Java concepts including object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, common libraries (such as `pandas`, `NumPy` for data processing), and core syntax used in backend development.

### Topics:
- **Classes and Objects**
- **Inheritance and Polymorphism**
- **Data Structures** (`ArrayLists`, `HashMaps`, etc.)
- **Exception Handling**
- **Java Streams API**

---

## 2. JUnit Testing

JUnit is a widely used framework for unit testing Java applications. This section demonstrates how to create and run unit tests to verify the behavior of your Java code.

### Topics:
- **Setting up JUnit** (`JUnit 5` setup and dependencies)
- **Writing Unit Tests** for individual Java methods
- **Mocking with Mockito** for dependencies
- **Test Suites** for running multiple tests

---

## 3. Spring Boot

Spring Boot simplifies the process of creating production-ready applications. This section shows how to set up a Spring Boot application, configure REST APIs, and connect to databases.

### Topics:
- **Spring Boot Setup** (initial setup with Spring Initializr)
- **RESTful APIs** using `@RestController` and `@RequestMapping`
- **Database Integration** using Spring Data JPA
- **Security** with Spring Security
- **Spring Boot Actuator** for monitoring and management

---

## 4. Microservices Architecture

This section explains how to design and develop microservices using Spring Boot. The focus is on creating independent, scalable services that can communicate with each other.

### Topics:
- **Creating Microservices** with Spring Boot
- **Service Discovery** using Netflix Eureka
- **API Gateway** using Spring Cloud Gateway
- **Inter-Service Communication** using REST and Feign Client
- **Distributed Tracing** with Spring Cloud Sleuth and Zipkin
- **Resilience** using Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker

---

## 5. Setup and Configuration

### Prerequisites:
- **Java JDK 11 or higher**
- **Maven** for dependency management
- **Spring Boot** 2.x
- **JUnit 5** for unit testing
- **MySQL** or any other relational database for persistence
- **Docker** (optional, for containerization)

### Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/java-springboot-microservices.git
2.Navigate to the project directory:
  ```bash
  cd java-springboot-microservices
```
3.Build the project using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
```
6. Running the Application
To run the Spring Boot application locally, use the following command:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
This will start the application at http://localhost:8080.

```
7. Testing
To run the unit tests with JUnit, use the following command:
```bash
mvn test
JUnit tests will be executed, and the results will be displayed in the terminal.
