# Java Cheat Sheet

## 1. Introduction to Java

- **What is Java?**  
  Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is used for building platform-independent applications.

- **Java Features**:
  - **Platform Independent**: Java code is compiled into bytecode, which can be run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
  - **Object-Oriented**: Java is based on the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), which promotes modularity and code reuse.
  - **Secure**: Java has built-in security features such as bytecode verification and a security manager to restrict access to system resources.
  - **Robust**: Java emphasizes strong memory management, exception handling, and type checking to prevent crashes and errors.
  - **Multithreaded**: Java supports concurrent programming, allowing multiple threads to run simultaneously for efficient resource use.

## 2. Java Syntax

- **Main Method**: The entry point of any Java application.

  ```java
  public class Main {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          // Code to be executed
      }
  }
